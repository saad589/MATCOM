MATCOM is a simple interface for coupled neutron transport (Monte Carlo)
and thermo-hydraulics (subchannel) external iterative calculation.
The scheme obtains results of the coupled solutions with Serpent/COBRA-EN coupled codes.


This repository contains:

1. Fortran source files.
2. A CMake profile. 
3. Readme and license declaration.

Both Serpent and COBRA-EN are distribution-controlled nuclear codes and must be obtained through OECD/NEA or RSICC (or similar entities).  

## Adapting this Repository

To use the MATCOM repository, run the following commands:

```sh
$ git clone --branch master https://github.com/saad589/matcom.git MATCOM
$ cd MATCOM
$ rm -rf .git/
$ git init
```

## CMake Build

This project uses [CMake](https://cmake.org/) to control the compilation process. GNU Fortran compilers should be present in the system. Generate the configuration files with the following commands: 

```sh
$ cmake -E chdir ./Build cmake ./..
```

After generating the makefiles, compile MATCOM using the following command: 
```sh
$ make -C Build 
```

This will build the libraries and the executable called ``matcom`` inside the Build directory. Additionally, a bash script is provided to automate the build process (deprecated). 

## Usage

Serpent should be present in the cluster as a symlink. The executable of COBRA-EN should be placed in the same directory as the executable of MATCOM or the directory where MATCOM is invoked. Additionally, a configuration file called ``matcom.conf`` must be present. The configuration file should have three lines:

1. The number of nodes.
2. The number of iterations (MATCOM doesn't have a convergence routine yet).
3. The absolute path of the neutron cross-sections files. 


Run MATCOM by simply typing:  

```sh
$ matcom 
```
MATCOM will create new directories and accumulate the results of the iterative calculation. The result is given in the ``matcom_res.m`` file. This file can be read with MATLAB/OCTAVE.
